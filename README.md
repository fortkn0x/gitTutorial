Now I can write some text here. This is my project. Check it out!
1. List item 1

- bullet points
- must put a space afterwards!

- the hashtag at the top registers "markdown" which is like html-lite, it auto formats ur text
- the stuff that comes after the hashtag is the Header of the page
- one asterisk by itself is an alternative to the bullet point list
* like this its now a bulletpoint
* This is how you *italicize* some text
* this is how you **bold** some text!
* You could also do it with _italicize_ and __bold__
* ta da!

```
//code goes between here
console.log("mY CODE WORKS PERFECTLY!);
```

* you can go to markdown API to see how this stuff works, as well! : D

0. git init //makes a new folder
```
